# Road to Reality

This project contains solution to problems from the book "Road to Reality" 
by Roger Penrose.

The solutions are either in pure latex of jupyter notebook format. 
In some cases, the jupyter notebooks contain graphics.

I will be adding chapters as I go through the problems. 
Sometimes I go back and fill in details for past chapters. 
In general, if a problem is missing is either because I found it too easy or too hard.
