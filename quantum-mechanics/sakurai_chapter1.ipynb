    "## Notational issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Bras and kets are intrinsically confusing because the mix the idea of a vector with the idea of the inner product.  Sakurai's notation is extra confusing as he often uses the same symbol to represent the operator, eigenvalue, and eignestate. There is also ambiguity when the operator acts on the left or the right. The mathematical notation for inner product does not suffer from this ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bra{a}\\hat{X}$. Does X act on the left on $\\bra{a}$? What if I multiply with another vector to get \n",
    "$\\bra{a}\\hat{X}\\ket{b}$. Now it looks like it acts on the right $\\hat{X}\\ket{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathmetical notation: $<a,\\hat{X}b>$ acts on the right and $<\\hat{X}a, b>$ acts on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "To aleviate part of the confusion, whenever there is ambiguity, I will write the operator with a hat $\\hat{A}$. So $\\hat{x}$ would be the position operator. I will also use the the same lowercase letter to indicate eignestates of this operator $\\ket{a}$. \n",
    "When there is more than one, I explicitly specify an index $\\ket{a_n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For states, I prefer to use $\\phi, \\psi$, etc instead of $\\alpha, \\beta$.\n",
